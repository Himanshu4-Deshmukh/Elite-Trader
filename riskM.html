        <p>In his book "The Disciplined Trader," Mark Douglas says that successful trading is 80 percent money management and 20 percent strategy. Risk Management comes into play at this point.</p>
<br>
   <p>
    Unfortunately, the majority of traders neglect risk management, which is one of the most crucial aspects of trading for success.
   </p>
<br>
   <p>

    Believe it or not, I've seen many traders and investors lose a lot of money because they don't pay enough attention to risk management when trading or investing.
   </p>
<br>
   <p>
    Before I continue, I'd like to share a well-known line from hedge fund manager Larry Hite,

   </p>
<br>
   <p>
     <b>
      "I have two fundamental rules for winning in life and trading:
      <br>
      1. If you don't bet, you can't win.  <br>
      2. If you lose all your chips, you can't bet."


     </b>

   </p>
   <br>
<p>
   Another important thing to keep in mind is that it becomes more difficult to recover a loss that is larger in the future.
 </p>  

 <div class="w-full m-0 p-2">
  <img src="png.img\loss.jpg"
    class="md:w-2/ h-auto  object-cover object-center mx-auto mt-4 mb-" />
</div>

<br>

<p>

  To recover from a loss of 10% you need to make a gain of approx 11 % in the future. But at the same time, to recover from a loss of 50% you need to make a gain of 100% in the future. Hence it is very important to manage risk at all times while trading.

</p>
<br><br>
<h1 class="text-2xl ml-1">Risk Management - </h1><br>
<p>

  Risk management aids in minimizing losses and safeguarding a trader's account from total loss. After all, a trader who has made a lot of money can lose it all in just one or two bad trades if they don't have a good risk management plan.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  For many people, risk management is still the most underrated aspect of trading, despite the fact that it is essential to long-term success.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Therefore, my humble request is that you never undervalue the significance of risk management in your trading journey.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<h1 class="text-2xl ml-1">Risk Management Strategies - </h1><br>

<p>
  Rules and strategies for risk management are not difficult to understand; even a novice can easily understand them. The only issue is that trading involves human emotions like ego, greed, and fear, making it difficult for people to implement them.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  It would take a lot of practice for a beginner to become habit  to using these risk management strategies in every trade.
</p>
<br>
<li>Following the Trend</li>
<li>Plan the Trade</li>
<li>Trade with appropriate Risk : Reward Ratio</li>
<li>Control Emotions</li>
<li>Position Sizing</li>
<li>Applying Strict Stop Loss</li>
<li>Booking Profits</li>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 class="text-2xl ml-1">1. Following the Trend - </h1><br>
<p> Trading in the direction of the trend is one of the most important, fundamental, and straightforward approaches to risk management.</p>
<p>
  When you trade with the current trend, you automatically reduce your risk of losing money because your chances of being wrong are very low.
</p>

<br>
<p>
  Make an effort to take long positions, such as buying at support and selling at resistance, if a security or index is clearly in an uptrend.
</p>
<br>
<p>Similarly, if a security or index is clearly in a downtrend, try taking short positions—selling at resistance and buying back at support—to take advantage of that trend.</p>
<p>Never ever try to take contrarian trades i.e., never trade against the trend.</p>
<br>
<p> Always remember - <b>"Trend is Your Friend."</b></p>

<br>
<h1 class="text-2xl ml-1">2. Plan the Trade -</h1><br>
<p>
  An old saying in business is, "If you fail to plan, you plan to fail." Trading involves exactly the same thing.
</p>
<p>Highly disciplined traders always trade in accordance with their trading plan.</p>

<br>

<p>
  Trading success necessitates having a strategy. It mostly concerns when to enter a trade, how long to hold it, and when to exit it. A person who does not have a trading plan will end up making random trades, not adhering to a specific entry or exit strategy, and will ultimately lose money.
</p>

<p>
  The practice of keeping a trading journal comes in handy in this situation.
</p>

  <div class="w-full border-b border-black  ">
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h1 class="text-2xl ml-1">3. Trade with appropriate Risk-Reward Ratio  -</h1><br>
<p> Trading based on a predetermined risk-reward ratio is an important risk management strategy.</p>
<p>Investors can better control their risk of losing money on trades by using the risk-to-reward ratio. </p>
<br>
<p>The risk-reward ratio measures how much money a trade could make or lose. It is calculated by dividing the difference between the profit target and the trade's entry point (reward) by the difference between the risk and the stop loss order (risk). </p>

<br>
<p>
  If you put a stop loss of, say, 10 unit, your expected profit from that trade should be 20 unit, according to a risk-reward ratio of 1:2.
</p>
<p>Ideally, one should have a risk-to-reward ratio of at least 1:2 in order to consistently make money in trading.</p>
<br>
<p>
  Regarding the ideal risk-to-reward ratio, there is no general rule. It is entirely dependent on a person's willingness to take risks and trading style. It will take some trial and error to figure out the best ratio for you, but it should always be greater than 1:2.
</p>
<p>
  A trader should determine the potential risk-to-reward ratio of any trade before entering it, and if it falls below the acceptable risk-to-reward ratio, no trades should be entered.
</p>

<br>

<h1 class="text-2xl ml-1">4. Control Emotions -</h1><br>
<p>Financial markets are frequently identified as being driven primarily by fear and greed. They also contribute significantly to the psychology of trading.</p>
<p>When a trader hesitates to enter a trade or prematurely closes a winning trade, fear is frequently evident. On the other hand, greed shows up when a trader wants to make a lot of money quickly by putting more capital into winning trades or by over-leveraging and taking risks that he can't handle.</p>
<br>

<p>You will never be able to consistently make money even if you have a good plan and trading system, but you will never be able to make money if you do not follow it honestly because of fear and greed due to market movements.</p>

<p> Therefore, if you want to be successful in trading over the long term, you must exercise self-control and ensure that your trading decisions are not influenced by fear or greed.</p>

<br>
<p>For beginners, I recommend reading books on Trading Psychology to learn more about this vast topic of trading emotion control.</p>

<h1 class="text-2xl ml-1">5. Position Sizing -</h1><br>
<p>
  When trading, position sizing is an important risk management strategy. It is a method for determining the size of a trader's position, as the name suggests. In other words, it is the amount of money a trader invests in a particular trade.
</p>

<br>
<p> When determining the size of a trading position, a trader's risk-taking capacity and portfolio trading capital should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p> </p>

<br>
<br>

<h1 class="text-2xl ml-1">6. Applying Strict Stop Loss -</h1><br>
<p>Using a strict stop loss is one of the easiest and most efficient ways to manage risk. </p>
<p>If the market goes against you, the purpose of using a stop loss is to close your losing position before you lose too much money and lose a significant amount of your trading capital.</p>

   <div class="w-full border-b border-white mt-4 mb-4">
          <div class="w-full border-b border-black  ">
          </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1 class="text-2xl ml-1">7. Booking Profits -  </h1><br>
        <p>When trading in securities, it is also very important to take regular profits from your positions. You should have a clear plan for when to exit your position or take a profit before entering any trading position. </p>
<br>
        <p>
          Despite the fact that it is commonly held that trading success necessitates learning to minimize losses and maximize profits. But at the same time, as a trader, you should always keep in mind that real profit is what you book; anything else is just profit on paper and not real profit. Profit can disappear at any time, and in extreme circumstances, it can also turn into loss.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> The idea of a trailing stop loss is typically used by professional traders to book profits. </p>
